# Contributing to NoobCloud

I don't have a very strict policy towards PRs. Please keep everything clear and consider opening one PR per feature if
you plan to make several changes. In order to support me, it would be nice if you could test your changes.

## Formatting
Please follow the code style used in this project.

## Issues
Please open one issuer per bug/feature request and choose an appropriate title.
